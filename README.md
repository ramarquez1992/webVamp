## Abstract
Guitar amplifiers take the electrical signal from an instrument and strengthen it to be pushed out through a speaker system. They are often prohibitively expensive or overly complex. A new system has been developed to make virtual guitar amplification available through the web. This allows users to be able to access virtual guitar amplification more quickly and easily than through a traditional digital audio workstation.
